- Dark mode (#0a0a0a) as default, light mode as toggled state
- Orange (#FF8C00) as primary accent color with black text for contrast
- Keep yellow (#FFD700) for lightbulb glow animation
- Outfit font for modern geometric sans-serif aesthetic
- Blocking script placed after fonts, before CSS to prevent FOLT
