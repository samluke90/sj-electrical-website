# SJ Electrical Contractors Website

## What This Is

A professional website for SJ Electrical Contractors Limited, a London-based electrical services company. The site serves as the primary online presence to attract domestic and commercial customers seeking electrical work in London and surrounding areas.

## Core Value

Potential customers can quickly understand what services are offered, trust the business (NICEIC certification), and easily get in touch for a quote.

## Requirements

### Validated

- ✓ Basic site structure with multiple pages — existing
- ✓ Quote request form — existing
- ✓ Dark/light mode toggle — existing
- ✓ Responsive design — existing

### Active

- [ ] Replace all placeholder content with real business information
- [ ] Redesign to minimalist black/white/orange aesthetic
- [ ] Remove spark cursor effect
- [ ] Lightbulb animation only on first site visit (skip on internal navigation)
- [ ] Update typography to modern geometric sans-serif
- [ ] Ensure dark mode is default, light mode available via toggle

### Out of Scope

- Social media integration — no accounts yet, use placeholders
- Online booking system — simple contact form is sufficient for now
- Blog/news section — not needed for v1
- Customer portal/login — overkill for this business

- Already has dark mode toggle (light switch style)
- Has lightbulb loading animation
- Has spark cursor effect (to be removed)

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Black as default, keep toggle | User wants dark aesthetic but flexibility for light mode | — Pending |
| Orange accent color | Matches inspiration image, works with electrical theme | — Pending |
| Remove spark cursor | Too playful for professional look | — Pending |
| Session-based loading animation | Good first impression but annoying on repeat | — Pending |
