# Milestone v1.1: Color Fixes + Form Functionality

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-22
**Phases:** 4-5
**Total Plans:** 2

## Overview

This milestone completed two finishing touches for the v1.0 website: fixing dark mode color issues (form inputs, footer, button contrast) and implementing functional form submission via n8n webhook. Both were independent workstreams executed sequentially.

## Phases

### Phase 4: Styling Fixes

**Goal:** All UI elements display with proper contrast and consistent dark mode styling.
**Depends on:** None (builds on v1.0 CSS)
**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md - Fix dark mode contrast for form inputs, footer, and CTA buttons

**Requirements:**
- STYLE-01: Form inputs have dark background with light text in dark mode
- STYLE-02: Footer has subtle dark background (#111) with light text in dark mode
- STYLE-03: Buttons on orange backgrounds use dark fill with white text
- STYLE-04: All color combinations maintain readable contrast in both modes

**Success Criteria:**
1. Form input fields on quote page are clearly visible with dark background and light text
2. Footer section has distinct but subtle dark background that separates it from main content
3. CTA buttons on orange hero sections use dark fill (readable against orange)
4. Toggling between dark and light mode shows all text remains readable (no low-contrast combinations)

### Phase 5: Form Functionality

**Goal:** Users can submit the quote form and receive confirmation of their request.
**Depends on:** None (form HTML already exists from v1.0)
**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 05-01-PLAN.md - Implement form submission with validation and error handling

**Requirements:**
- FORM-01: Quote form submits to webhook endpoint
- FORM-02: Form submission sends email to info@sjec.uk
- FORM-03: User sees success message after submission
- FORM-04: User sees error message if submission fails

**Success Criteria:**
1. User fills out quote form and clicks submit - form data is sent to webhook
2. Business owner receives email at info@sjec.uk with form contents
3. After successful submission, user sees a clear success message (form replaced or overlay)
4. If submission fails (network error, validation), user sees an error message with guidance

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- CSS-01: Used explicit #111111 for footer (legacy --dark token maps to white text)
- CSS-02: Added explicit light mode CTA override for consistency
- CSS-03: Changed focus ring from blue to orange accent color
- FORM-01: Used n8n webhook for form backend (switched from Formspree)
- FORM-02: Accessible error display with ARIA attributes

**Issues Resolved:**
- Form inputs invisible in dark mode (white on white)
- Footer blended with main content in dark mode
- CTA button unreadable on orange section

**Issues Deferred:**
- None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None
