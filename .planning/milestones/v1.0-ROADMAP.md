# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-21
**Phases:** 1-3
**Total Plans:** 6

## Overview

Transform the existing SJ Electrical website from its current state into a professional, minimalist black/white/orange design with accurate business information. The work naturally divided into three phases: cleaning up interaction effects, establishing the new design system, and updating all content with real business details.

## Phases

### Phase 1: UX Cleanup

**Goal**: Site interactions feel professional and non-intrusive
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Remove spark cursor effect (preserve light switch burst)
- [x] 01-02: Session-based loading animation with cross-tab sync

**Details:**
- Removed spark cursor effect (mouse trail particles and click arcs)
- Preserved createSparkBurst() for light switch toggle interaction
- Animation plays once per browser session with cross-tab sync
- Reduced animation duration from ~2.4s to ~1.2s

### Phase 2: Design System

**Goal**: Site presents a cohesive black/white/orange minimalist aesthetic
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: Core design system (CSS tokens, typography, theme inversion)
- [x] 02-02: Theme flash prevention and spacing refinement

**Details:**
- Dark-first design tokens (#0a0a0a background, #FF8C00 orange accent)
- Outfit geometric font across all 5 HTML pages
- Inverted light switch toggle logic for dark-first default
- Blocking theme script prevents flash of light theme
- 64px section padding for minimalist whitespace

### Phase 3: Content Update

**Goal**: All content reflects accurate SJ Electrical business information
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01: Update contact details, service area, NICEIC, and testimonial placeholders
- [x] 03-02: Add social media placeholder links to all footers

**Details:**
- Contact: 07875 210 678, info@sjec.uk, 157 Waltham Way
- NICEIC Approved Contractor status displayed
- Service area: London and surrounding areas
- Testimonials marked with data-placeholder for future real reviews
- Social media links (Facebook/Instagram) with placeholder URLs

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:**
- None (no urgent insertions during v1.0)

**Key Decisions:**
- Dark mode (#0a0a0a) as default, light mode as toggled state
- Orange (#FF8C00) as primary accent color with black text for contrast
- Outfit font for modern geometric sans-serif aesthetic
- Blocking script placed after fonts, before CSS to prevent FOLT
- Section padding uses --space-3xl (64px) for generous whitespace
- data-placeholder attribute marks placeholder content for future updates

**Issues Resolved:**
- Spark cursor effect removed for professional appearance
- Session detection prevents annoying animation repeats
- FOLT prevented with blocking theme script

**Issues Deferred:**
- 9 CSS declarations still reference Montserrat font (uses system fallback)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- Legacy Montserrat font references (non-blocking, system fallback works)
