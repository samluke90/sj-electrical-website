<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Ensure 44px minimum touch targets for all interactive elements</name>
  <files>css/styles.css</files>
  <action>
Review and update the following elements to ensure minimum 44x44px touch targets (WCAG 2.5.8 recommended):

1. **.record-btn** (Voice record button):
   - Ensure min-height: 44px
   - Ensure min-width: 44px or sufficient padding
   - Current padding: 12px 20px - should be adequate, verify height

2. **.symptom-option span** (Symptom checker pills):
   - Current padding: 8px 16px - may be too small
   - Update to min-height: 44px with appropriate padding
   - Ensure touch target is at least 44px even if visual is smaller

3. **.btn-whatsapp** (WhatsApp button):
   - Inherits from .btn which has padding: 14px 28px
   - Verify min-height: 44px is achieved

4. **.delete-voice-btn** (Delete recording button):
   - Current: width/height: 36px - TOO SMALL
   - Update to min-width: 44px, min-height: 44px

5. **.preview-remove** (Photo remove button):
   - Check size and update if needed

Add a mobile breakpoint section if needed to ensure touch targets are met on small screens.
  </action>
  <verify>
Read the updated CSS and verify:
- .record-btn has adequate size (min-height: 44px or padding that achieves this)
- .symptom-option span has min-height: 44px
- .delete-voice-btn has min-width/min-height: 44px
- All interactive elements meet 44px minimum
  </verify>
  <done>All interactive elements have minimum 44x44px touch targets for mobile accessibility</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Verify and fix dark/light mode styling consistency</name>
  <files>css/styles.css</files>
  <action>
Review the light mode overrides for all new components and ensure consistency:

1. **Voice recorder components:**
   - .record-btn in light mode: ensure visible border and text
   - .recording-indicator in light mode: already has override, verify it works
   - .voice-playback in light mode: already has #f5f5f5 background

2. **Symptom checker:**
   - .symptom-checker in light mode: already has #f5f5f5 background
   - .symptom-option span in light mode: already has #fff background
   - Verify selected state (input:checked + span) is visible in both modes

3. **WhatsApp button:**
   - Uses fixed #25D366 green - should work in both modes
   - Verify text color contrast

4. **Error container:**
   - Verify .form-errors (or #form-errors) is visible in both dark and light modes
   - Should use --color-error or similar semantic color

Check for any missing [data-theme="light"] overrides for new components.
Add any necessary light mode adjustments.
  </action>
  <verify>
Read CSS and verify [data-theme="light"] rules exist for:
- .symptom-checker
- .symptom-option span
- .voice-playback
- .recording-indicator
- Error states if applicable
  </verify>
  <done>All new components styled consistently in both dark and light modes</done>
</task>

  <what-built>
Touch target sizing (44px minimum) for all interactive elements and dark/light mode styling consistency.
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Open the quote page in a browser: file:///path/to/website/quote.html
2. Use browser DevTools to inspect touch target sizes:
   - Record button: should be at least 44x44px
   - Symptom option pills: should be at least 44x44px height
   - Delete voice button: should be at least 44x44px
   - WhatsApp button: should be at least 44x44px

3. Test dark mode (default):
   - Voice recorder section visible and styled
   - Symptom checker (select Fault Finding) visible and styled
   - Selected symptom options show orange background

4. Toggle to light mode (click theme toggle):
   - Voice recorder section still visible with appropriate contrast
   - Symptom checker has light background
   - Selected symptom options still visible

5. Test on mobile viewport (Chrome DevTools device mode, 375px width):
   - All buttons easily tappable
   - Symptom options stack vertically and fill width
   - Voice recorder stacks properly
