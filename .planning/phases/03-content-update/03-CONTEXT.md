## Implementation Decisions

### Services display
- Card-based layout with icons for each service
- Each card shows: icon, service title, 2-3 bullet points of what's included
- Static cards — informational only, no click navigation
- Hover effects for visual feedback acceptable

### Claude's Discretion
- Service grouping (whether to categorize by type like Domestic/Commercial/Safety)
- Icon selection for each service
- Card grid layout (columns, spacing)
- How other content sections are structured (trust signals, contact, placeholders)
