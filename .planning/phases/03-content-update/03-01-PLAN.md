<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 5: Update testimonials with placeholder markers</name>
  <files>index.html</files>
  <action>
    The testimonials section currently has fake testimonials. Update them to be clearly marked as placeholders:

    For each testimonial-card in index.html:
    1. Add `data-placeholder="true"` attribute to the card
    2. Update the testimonial-text to realistic-sounding but obviously placeholder text
    3. Keep the structure intact for future replacement

    Example updated testimonial:
    ```html
    <div class="testimonial-card" data-animate data-placeholder="true">
        <div class="testimonial-stars">&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</div>
        <p class="testimonial-text">"[Awaiting customer review - placeholder text for layout purposes]"</p>
        <div class="testimonial-author">
            <div class="author-avatar">??</div>
            <div class="author-info">
                <h4>Customer Name</h4>
                <p>London Area</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    ```

    Update all 3 testimonial cards to use this placeholder pattern.
    Also update the section header text to say "What Our Customers Say" (keep) but the subtitle can be updated to something like "Reviews coming soon - we'd love to hear from our customers!"
  </action>
  <verify>
    Check index.html testimonials section:
    - All 3 cards have data-placeholder="true"
    - Text indicates placeholder status
    - Structure remains intact for future real testimonials
  </verify>
  <done>
    - Testimonial cards marked as placeholders
    - Placeholder text makes it clear these aren't real reviews
    - Structure preserved for easy future updates
  </done>
</task>
